a.BadStore’s cart cookie is also an encoded string with a predictable structure XXX:YYY:… etc., and it probably contains information it shouldn’t.
 Which field of the decoded string could an attacker change to give himself a discount on an item’s price?
Ans:
Login as joe@supplier.com -> iforgot
go to whats new ->add items to cart
in search bar -> <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
After getting the CartID value , and url-decoding it using https://www.urldecoder.org
 CartID=1527258326%3A1%3A11.5%3A1000; 

After url-decoding 1527258326:1:11.5:1000 

Field 1 : 1527258326 is a unix timestamp 
Field 2 : “Useless” 
Field 3 : 11.5 is the price 
Field 4 : 1000 is the item id. 
So the attacker needs to edit the price field which is the third order.
